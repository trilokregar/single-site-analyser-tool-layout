                                Bata India came up with a 3D OOH billboard that utilizes an anamorphic image content
                                creation format thereby making content appear in 3 dimensions, which are visually
                                compelling. Bata has used this innovative OOH technology to highlight the variety of
                                sneakers it offers with the Sneaker Studios launched across 300+ stores across the
                                country.
                            </p>
                            <p>This 3D billboard is a visual treat for potential consumers and immediately commands
                                attention. Thus it increases impression numbers and dwell time for audiences. The OOH
                                advertising features sneakers from various brands like Power, that’s used for fitness
                                and NorthStar, the lifestyle sneaker brand from Bata. Made to engage its right Target
                                Group which happens to be youth audiences, the 3D Out of Home Advertisement seamlessly
                                marries various animations like a moving skateboard, sneakers popping out of a shoe box
                                and a train of multiple sneakers streaming from the billboard thereby creating a
                                compelling story.</p>

                                    “At Bata India, we are constantly looking for innovative ways to engage with our
                                    audience. We are elated to be one of the first few brands and especially, the first
                                    footwear brand in India to bring the disruptive format of 3D OOH advertising. As we
                                    offer over 300 sneakers styles from 9 international brands in our new Sneaker
                                    Studios, a
                                    shop-in-shop destination inside Bata stores, we thought of leveraging the new 3D
                                    emerging outdoor media to announce this launch.<br />
                                    Consumers can experience Sneaker Studio
                                    in their neighborhood Bata stores and get to shop their favorite styles instantly or
                                    even order them via home delivery service.”

                                    am happy to see that BATA company is the first
                                    footwear brand in India to come up with the 3D OOH advertising and innovating itself
                                    over the time by being on top of with all creative ideas within the OOH industry.
                                    As per him, AdMAVIN has done several research papers and demonstrated through its
                                    tool that creative OOH Campaigns definitely increase OTS(Opportunity to See) and
                                    Dwell time. Campaign Planning around 3D OOH Campaigns is bound to be successful but
                                    it's also costly.”
