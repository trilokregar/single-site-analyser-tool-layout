                        <span class="d-block">“After two years of restrictions and lockdowns, this year, people are gearing up to celebrate the festivals in a big way. From sharing your idea of festive fun and your favorite festival food, puja pandals you’d like to visit, a garba dance you’ve been eyeing to attend–festivals can be an exciting time to find new connections that you’re looking for! With our latest campaign, we aim to encourage our community to own their dating journeys and find their connections on Bumble.”</span>
                        <span class="d-block pt-2">Over the past two years, Bumble has introduced a number of product and policy changes to best support its community. This included new features to navigate virtual dating, Audio Prompts and Videos on Profile, Audio Notes, in-app Covid-19 preferences to easily communicate how people are comfortable dating and 150 new interest badges in dating profiles to showcase your hobbies and interests easily.</span>
