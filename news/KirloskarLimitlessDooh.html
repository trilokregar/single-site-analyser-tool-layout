                                OOH at the Mumbai Airport in partnership with Times OOH.

                                The spirit of innovation and purpose was captured through a new OOH Campaign –
                                “Limitless” last year which has now been taken to the masses with the help of Airport
                                Campaign.<br />
                                The refreshing and re-energizing new campaign looks to expound on the Limitless
                                philosophy in a simple, relatable & engaging manner that celebrates the brand’s shared
                                philosophy with that of the innate human desire to challenge the limits and live, think
                                and dream limitlessly. The brand in association with their advertisement media agency-
                                Lowe Lintas has worked on designing the right creatives that easily explains the brand
                                philosophy and offerings. Hence, the creatives were coined using the greatest
                                manifestation of people who truly believe there are no limits – children.

                                The OOH campaign’s creative aims to draw a likeness between the child-like belief and
                                imagination that anything can be made possible. It definitely increases audience
                                impression numbers and dwell time as Digital OOH medium gives more scope for innovation.

                                The brand is strategically running multiple creatives on a variety of Digital screens
                                across the departure and arrival of the airport. Digital OOH media is giving an extended
                                reach to the brand with multiple creatives as the format ensures the continued interest
                                and attention of the passengers at the Mumbai Airport. The campaign has been deployed
                                for a duration of three months.
