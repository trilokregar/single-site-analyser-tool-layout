                    <p>It's very often that Brands and even Media-Agencies get confused while selecting out of home media sites for campaigns as they are very much similar.</p>
                    <div class="img-cont px-5">
                        <img class="img-news img-bordered p-1" src="../assets/news/media-selection/city.png">
                    </div>

                    <p>So can brands make the right selection in media sites which targets their audience, boost marketing and contribute towards sales generation. Brands mostly have the following goals by doing billboard based advertising-</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pitching an advertisement to the proper target group.</li>
                        <li>Reaching out to the maximum number of target groups.</li>
                        <li>Covering Competitor Influence Region/Area.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Let’s say there is a series of two types of Unipole which satisfies all the three ask/goals of the campaign. So how should one finalize one of those media sites? What are the criteria for selection of media sites?</p>

                    <p>Media sites types are important as advertisement has to be visible to your target audience. You must have noticed a certain slant in elevation, tilt and particular size billboards. You may think that it's arbitrary but actually it's very well thought out and full of rationale.</p>
