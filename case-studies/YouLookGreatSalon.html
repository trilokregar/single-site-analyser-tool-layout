                      YLG is a women salon and spa chain with an online store based out of Bangalore. It offers
                      innovative beauty services that women need for a complete couture look. In order to
                      increase the brand awareness, retain visibility and footfalls to their stores, they had engaged
                      in Billboard advertising at locations close to their stores.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      When <a href="https://www.admavin.com"> AdMAVIN </a> reached out to them, YLG wanted to know if we could help them
                      gauge the efficacy of their existing billboards and, if possible, suggest alternatives which might
                      be more cost-effective.

                    <h4>The Requirements</h4>
                    <p>
                      Billboards serve as an excellent reminder medium, helping gain top-of-the-mind recall
                      amongst customers when they are outside their homes. In the case of John Jacobs, they have
                      opened stores in the commercial hubs of Indiranagar and Koramangala (where people often
                      come with the purpose of shopping / hanging out with friends), and the purpose of the
                      billboard advertisements was to increase footfalls to their stores.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The task at hand was to ensure that using our proprietary <a href="https://www.admavin.com/"> MAVIN</a> platform, we needed to
                      suggest billboards which would be more effective (in terms of visibility and therefore creating
                      brand awareness) while ensuring that they are well within their stipulated budget.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      YLG's campaign was conducted over 15+ billboards across the city. For the study purpose,
                      we selected four billboards, one billboard in Indiranagar, one in Koramangala near Sony
                      World signal, one in Jayanagar near Canara bank and one in Cambridge layout.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Challenges</h4>
                    <p>
                      The customer segment of YLG is predominantly Sec-A and Sec-B women, who aspire for
                      great looks. While suggesting better alternatives, we needed to ensure that the
                      demographics of the target population of the billboards doesn't change.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">At present, the billboards have been selected keeping the following aspects in mind –</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Presence on routes leading to the stores</li>
                      <li>Distance of billboard to store &lt; 2 km</li>
                      <li>Apparent cost / Approximate views (the lower the better)</li>
                      <li>General understanding of profile of public crossing those billboards</li>

                      current billboard on which YLG is advertising at Indiranagar. We see that the CPM also
                      increases by <b>1.02x</b>. Also, comparison is not only dependent on the quantitative analysis,
                      demographics also plays a hand. Having an understanding of best location boost the
                      probability of message reaching to the right audience.

                      The billboards in Koramangala are of the same cost. Hence as the number or <b>impressions
                      increase by 1.5x</b> the <b>CPM is reduced by 1.5x</b>. The proposed site is at the junction and next to
                      a signal and hence better views are expected. Having a better Sustenance also suggests good
                      quality targeted customer in the region for YLG. Hence, knowing the demographics help. A

                      The site at Jayanagar is one of the best location for YLG to advertise for their store. With
                      backing from data, YLG should stick to purchasing with the mentioned site. However, gaining
                      an understanding of demographics, site selection could change. Though, not in this case as
                      demographics of the site are also favourable.

                      As seen above, we see a billboard on the same lane and almost of the same size and width is
                      a good alternate to the present billboard on Bellary road. AdMAVIN platform helps you
                      compare the quality of the billboard. In this case, the <b>quality of billboard</b> by YLG is better than
                      the alternate via a <b>small fraction i.e. 4.2:4</b>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                      The case study on YLG's billboard provided multiple striking and valuable insights. We
                      explored a good understanding of billboard buying by YLG, as two among the four sites are
                      better than the suggested alternates. We compared alternates which were giving same
                      insights but differ in the alignment or quality of billboard. Also, we got to see that a proof of
                      validation by data selection is essential for media buying. In the clutter of advertising, data is
                      all that could help take informed decision. Both quantitative and qualitative data drives site
                      selection. Having an understanding of the same, you could be confident of your selections
                      and make decisions which boost your interactions with the customer.
